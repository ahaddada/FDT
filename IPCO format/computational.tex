\section{Computational experiments with FDT}\label{experiment}
We implement FDT to two covering problem. First, the tree argumentation problem (TAP) where given a tree $T=(V,E)$, and a set of link $L$ between the vertices in $V$ and costs $c\in \bbbr^{L}_{\geq 0}$ we with to find minimum cost subset $L'$ of $L$ such that $T+L'$ is 2-edge-connected. For $\ell\in L$, let $P_\ell$ be the set of edges in the unique path between the endpoints of $\ell$ in $T$. For TAP, $S(\mbox{TAP})=\{x\in \bbbz^{L}_{\geq 0}: \sum_{\ell: e\in P_\ell}x_\ell \geq 1, \mbox{ for $e\in E$}\}$. Relaxing the integrality constraint we get $P(\mbox{TAP})$. It is been shown that $\frac{3}{2}\leq g({\mbox{TAP}})\leq 2$ \cite{fj,32gap}. We applied the binary FDT algorithm on a set of 264 fractional extreme points of $P(\mbox{TAP})$. The result are summarized in Figure \ref{plotTAP}. 

Next we implemented the FDT for 2EC on a 900 fractional extreme points of $\EC(G)$. These points are obtained by considering all fundamental vertices with $12$ vertices (See \cite{CV} for the definition of fundamental vertices). The results are summarized in Figure \ref{plot2EC}. We also, implemented polyhedral version of Christofides' algorithm \cite{Wolsey1980} and compared its performance on fundamental extreme points with 10 vertices. The result are in Figure \ref{}.
