We obtain a structural characterization of optimal solutions. Specifically, there exists an optimal two-connected solution whose vertices all have degree 2 or 3, and such that the removal of any edge or pair of edges leaves a bridge in the resulting connected components. These are the strongest possible conditions on the structure of an optimal solution since we also show thatany two-connected graph satisfying these conditions is theunique optimal solution for a particular choice of `canonical' distances satisfying the triangle inequality. We use these properties to show that the weight of an optimal traveling salesman cycle is at most 4/3 times the weight of an optimal two-connected solution; examples are provided which approach this bound arbitrarily closely. In addition, we obtain similar results for the variation of this problem where the network need only span a prespecified subset of the points.",

Feasibility Pump (FP) is a heuristic scheme for finding a feasible solution to general MIPs that can be viewed as a clever way to round a sequence of fractional solutions of the LP relaxation, until a feasible one is eventually found. In this paper we study the effect of replacing the original rounding function (which is fast and simple, but somehow blind) with more clever rounding heuristics. In particular, we investigate the use of a diving-like procedure based on rounding and constraint propagation---a basic tool in Constraint Programming. Extensive computational results on binary and general integer MIPs from the literature show that the new approach produces a substantial improvement of the FP success rate, without slowing-down the method and with a significantly better quality of the feasible solutions found.",

	abstract = { The symmetric traveling salesman problem (STSP) is to find a minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle in a weighted complete graph on n nodes. One direction which seems promising for finding improved solutions for the STSP is the study of a linear relaxation of this problem called the subtour elimination problem (SEP). A well-known conjecture in combinatorial optimization says that the integrality gap of the SEP is 4/3 in the metric case. Finding the exact value for this integrality gap is challenging even for small values of n as it is difficult to model this problem in a way that can be solved practically. We describe how we are able to overcome such difficulties and obtain the exact integrality gap for all values of n up to 10 and a lower bound for this gap for all values of n from 11 to 14. Our results give rise to a new stronger form of the conjecture which is dependent on n. }

A k-cover of H is a multiset C of edges on V such that for every subset S in H, C has at least k edges that have exactly one end in S. A k-packing of H is a multiset P of edges on V such that for every subset S in H, P has at most k {\textperiodcentered} u(S) edges that have exactly one end in S. Here, u assigns an integer capacity to each subset in H. Our main results are: (a) Given a k-cover C of H, there is an efficient algorithm to find a 1-cover contained in C of size ≤ k|C|=(2k - 1). For 2-covers, the factor of 2=3 is best possible. (b) Given a 2-packing P of H, there is an efficient algorithm to find a 1-packing contained in P of size ≥ |P|/3. The factor of 1/3 for 2-packings is best possible.",

	abstract="Finding the exact integrality gap {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}$\alpha$ for the LP relaxation of the metric travelling salesman problem (TSP) has been an open problem for over 30 years, with little progress made. It is known that {\$}{\$}4/3 {\backslash}le {\backslash}alpha {\backslash}le 3/2{\$}{\$}4/3≤$\alpha$≤3/2, and a famous conjecture states {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha = 4/3{\$}{\$}$\alpha$=4/3. It has also been conjectured that the integrality gap is achieved for half-integer basic solutions of the linear program. For this problem, essentially two ``fundamental'' classes of instances have been proposed. This fundamental property means that in order to show that the integrality gap is at most {\$}{\$}{\backslash}rho {\$}{\$}$\rho$ for all instances of the metric TSP, it is sufficient to show it only for the instances in the fundamental class. However, despite the importance and the simplicity of such classes, no apparent effort has been deployed for improving the integrality gap bounds for them. In this paper we take a natural first step in this endeavour, and consider the 1 / 2-integer points of one such class. We successfully improve the upper bound for the integrality gap from 3 / 2 to 10 / 7 for a superclass of these points for which a lower bound of 4 / 3 is proved. A key role in the proof of this result is played by finding Hamiltonian cycles whose existence is equivalent to Kotzig's result on ``compatible Eulerian tours'', and which lead us to delta-matroids for developing the related algorithms. Our arguments also involve other innovative tools from combinatorial optimization with the potential of a broader use.",

The problem is of interest because of its relation to the famous 4/3 conjecture for metric TSP, which says that the integrality gap, i.e., the worst case ratio between the optimal values of the TSP and its linear programming relaxation, is 4/3. Using polyhedral techniques in an interesting way, we obtain a polynomial-time 4/3-approximation algorithm for this problem on cubic graphs, improving upon Christofides' 3/2-approximation, and upon the 3/2{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}5/389{\thinspace}≈{\thinspace}1.487-approximation ratio by Gamarnik, Lewenstein and Svirdenko for the case the graphs are also 3-edge connected. We also prove that, as an upper bound, the 4/3 conjecture is true for this problem on cubic graphs. For subcubic graphs we obtain a polynomial-time 7/5-approximation algorithm and a 7/5 bound on the integrality gap.",

 abstract = {This book presents the latest findings on one of the most intensely investigated subjects in computational mathematics--the traveling salesman problem. It sounds simple enough: given a set of cities and the cost of travel between each pair of them, the problem challenges you to find the cheapest route by which to visit all the cities and return home to where you began. Though seemingly modest, this exercise has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists. Teachers use it in the classroom. It has practical applications in genetics, telecommunications, and neuroscience.The authors of this book are the same pioneers who for nearly two decades have led the investigation into the traveling salesman problem. They have derived solutions to almost eighty-six thousand cities, yet a general solution to the problem has yet to be discovered. Here they describe the method and computer code they used to solve a broad range of large-scale problems, and along the way they demonstrate the interplay of applied mathematics with increasingly powerful computing platforms. They also give the fascinating history of the problem--how it developed, and why it continues to intrigue us.},

This provides the first asymptotic improvement over the long-standing Θ(log n)-approximation bound stemming from the work of Frieze et al. (1982) [Frieze AM, Galbiati G, Maffioki F (1982) On the worst-case performance of some algorithms for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. Networks 12(1):23–39]. The key ingredient of our approach is a new connection between the approximability of the ATSP and the notion of so-called thin trees. To exploit this connection, we employ maximum entropy rounding—a novel method of randomized rounding of LP relaxations of optimization problems. We believe that this method might be of independent interest. }

	abstract = { This paper explores new approaches to the symmetric traveling-salesman problem in which 1-trees, which are a slight variant of spanning trees, play an essential role. A 1-tree is a tree together with an additional vertex connected to the tree by two edges. We observe that (i) a tour is precisely a 1-tree in which each vertex has degree 2, (ii) a minimum 1-tree is easy to compute, and (iii) the transformation on “intercity distances” cij → Cij + πi + πj leaves the traveling-salesman problem invariant but changes the minimum 1-tree. Using these observations, we define an infinite family of lower bounds w(π) on C*, the cost of an optimum tour. We show that maxπw(π) = C* precisely when a certain well-known linear program has an optimal solution in integers. We give a column-generation method and an ascent method for computing maxπw(π), and construct a branch-and-bound method in which the lower bounds w(π) control the search for an optimum tour. }

We assume a symmetric, nonnegative distance functiond({\textperiodcentered}) defined onV {\texttimes} V which satisfies the triangle inequality. We obtain a structural characterization of optimal solutions. Specifically, there exists an optimal two-connected solution whose vertices all have degree 2 or 3, and such that the removal of any edge or pair of edges leaves a bridge in the resulting connected components. These are the strongest possible conditions on the structure of an optimal solution since we also show thatany two-connected graph satisfying these conditions is theunique optimal solution for a particular choice of `canonical' distances satisfying the triangle inequality. We use these properties to show that the weight of an optimal traveling salesman cycle is at most 4/3 times the weight of an optimal two-connected solution; examples are provided which approach this bound arbitrarily closely. In addition, we obtain similar results for the variation of this problem where the network need only span a prespecified subset of the points.",

Two well-known relaxations of the TSP are the subtour elimination problem and the 2-matching problem. If we let SUBT and 2M represent the optimal solution values for these two relaxations, then it has been conjectured that TOUR/SUBT ≤4/3, and that 2M/SUBT ≤10/9. In this paper, we exploit the structure of certain 1/2-integer solutions for the subtour elimination problem in order to obtain low cost TSP and 2-matching solutions. In particular, we show that for cost functions for which the optimal subtour elimination solution found falls into our classes, the above two conjectures are true. Our proofs are constructive and could be implemented in polynomial time, and thus, for such cost functions, provide a 4/3 (or better) approximation algorithm for the TSP."
