	abstract="Finding a feasible solution of a given mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is a very important {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}NP{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}-complete problem that can be extremely hard in practice. Feasibility Pump (FP) is a heuristic scheme for finding a feasible solution to general MIPs that can be viewed as a clever way to round a sequence of fractional solutions of the LP relaxation, until a feasible one is eventually found. In this paper we study the effect of replacing the original rounding function (which is fast and simple, but somehow blind) with more clever rounding heuristics. In particular, we investigate the use of a diving-like procedure based on rounding and constraint propagation---a basic tool in Constraint Programming. Extensive computational results on binary and general integer MIPs from the literature show that the new approach produces a substantial improvement of the FP success rate, without slowing-down the method and with a significantly better quality of the feasible solutions found.",

In this paper, we show that a slight strengthening of this conjecture implies a tight 4/3 integrality gap for a linear programming relaxation of the metric ATSP (Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem). Our main tools are a new characterization of the integrality gap for linear objective functions over polyhedra, and the isolation of ``hard-to-round'' solutions of the relaxations.",

We show that, for many interesting cases, there exist two elementsa andb of the groundset such that the problem is equivalent to the problem of minimizing the submodular function over the sets containinga but notb. This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for minimizing a submodular function over these families of sets. Our results apply, for example, to the families of odd cardinality subsets or even cardinality subsets separating two given vertices, or to the complement of a lattice family of subsets. We also derive that the second smallest value of a submodular function over a lattice family can be computed in polynomial-time. These results generalize and unify several known results.",
